git config --local credential.helper ""

From <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13103083/how-do-i-push-to-github-under-a-different-username> 


The above command is used to push the code from one account to other.
So if u give the above command then it will ask for username and passwd, give the credentials and push it.
